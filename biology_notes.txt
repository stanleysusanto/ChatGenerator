Different proteins can appear very different and perform diverse functions (e.g. the water-soluble antibodies
involved in the immune system and the water-insoluble keratin of hair, hooves and feathers). Despite this, each
one is made up of amino acid subunits.

There about 20 different amino acids that all have a similar chemical structure but behave in very different ways
because they have different side groups. Hence, stringing them together in different combinations produces very
different proteins.

When 2 amino acids are joined together (condensation) the amino group from one and the acid group from
another form a bond, producing one molecule of water. The bond formed is called a peptide bond.
